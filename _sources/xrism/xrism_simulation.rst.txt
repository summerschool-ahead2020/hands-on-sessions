XRISM simulation
================

In this exercise, we will simulate a XRISM spectrum using the ``heasim`` simulator and SPEX.
We will perform the following steps:

- Create a model spectrum with SPEX,
- Set source definition,
- Simulate event file,
- Extract spectrum.

We provide the exercise in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

Running the notebook on Sciserver
---------------------------------
Go to your own storage space in the Jupyterlab terminal (replace ``<user>`` by your user name)::

    (spex) idies@aaaa:~$ cd ~/workspace/Storage/<user>/persistent

You can download the notebook into your directory using this git command::

    (spex) idies@aaaa:~/workspace/Storage/<user>/persistent$ git clone https://github.com/summerschool-ahead2020/xrism-hands-on.git

You can open `simulate.ipynb` under the directory xrism-hands-on. It is self-contained and should work
in any directory on Sciserver.
