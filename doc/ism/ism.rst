ISM hands-on
============

You can download the exercises into your Sciserver image or in a directory on your laptop from Github::

  user@linux:~> git clone https://github.com/summerschool-ahead2020/ism-hands-on.git
  
In the `Renkulab image <https://renkulab.io/projects/j.de.plaa/ahead2020-school-spex/sessions>`_, the files 
should already be there in the ``notebooks/ism-hands-on/`` directory.
